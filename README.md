# COMP20007-Project1
My project 1 from COMP20007 (Design of Algorithms), semester 1, 2020 @ The University of Melbourne.

Project aim: Working with deques and graph data structures

This was my first project for COMP20007 written in C. I had already done one subject with C beforehand, COMP10002 Foundations of Algorithms.

Check out the specification file to see the details of the project. Only the coding questions are included in this repository. Question 1 is omitted.

Take note that some files (main.c, util.c, Makefile) and some templates of files' (deque.c and parkranger.c) are written by the teaching staff and are not my work. My work is the functions that the spec outlines must be implemented by us.

This was developed before I used git hence the lack of commits.

*I'm pretty sure this is the final version of this program. If it is completely broken then I uploaded the wrong one. Thank god I know git now.*
